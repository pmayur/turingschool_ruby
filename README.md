# Ruby Exercises

This is a collection of exercises to practice various aspects of Ruby. 

Practicing in this manner (small, bite-sized problems that you can do repeatedly) is a _fantastic_ way to solidify programming concepts. 

Each folder in this repository is a set of related exercises. Open up the folder and read the README to learn more about them.

_Note: If you've just stumbled across this repository online, and are looking to work through these exercises, consider working through these [setup instructions](http://mod0.turing.io/setup-instructions) and [this guide to installing rbenv and a version of ruby](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/backend_module_0_capstone#environment), as these two items are pre-requisites to working on these ruby exercises below._

## Getting Started

If you are new to Ruby, please see [Turing Prep Chapter 1: Make Mod 1 Easier Than It Otherwise Would Be](https://josh.works/turing-backend-prep-01-intro) for help getting started with these exercises.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
1. From the command line, `cd` into the `ruby-exercises` directory.
1. From the command line, run `bundle`
  * If you get an error saying that the command `bundle` was not found, first run `gem install bundler` and then try again. If `gem install bundler` doesn't work, make sure you've followed [mod0 setup instructions](http://mod0.turing.io/setup-instructions) and [installed rbenv and a version of ruby](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/backend_module_0_capstone#environment). [Other troubleshooting help here](https://josh.works/turing-backend-prep-troubleshooting-guide)

## Order

Here is a very rough suggested timeline for working on the exercises. This is just a suggestion, as the exercises can be completed in any order. 

Where there are video walk-throughs, it could be useful to watch the whole video. These walkthroughs touch on many useful concepts and tools you'll use for the rest of your time at Turing (and your job!), like `how to google well`, `terminal shortcuts`, `Atom configurations you should check out`, `pry and using a debugger`, and lots more. The time you spend watching and studying these walkthroughs will save you multiples of that time down the road.

> Isn't having a video walkthrough of one of these exercises a little like cheating?

Great question! These videos pair well with your learning goals for a few reasons:

1. There are only a few video walk-throughs. If you do _all_ of the exercises, you'll do many exercises without any assistance.
1. The things you learn from the walk-throughs will enable you to learn more and better understand what you're doing.
3. You don't _have_ to watch the videos before you start solving these exercises. You can use them _just_ when you get stuck. Each video has an "index" of what is covered at each point in the video, and where in the video I address a given test. For example, you can be stuck half-way through the `advanced_nested_collections` exercise, click through to the video, and jump right to the test you're working on. 

## Suggested workflow

After you do one of these exercises, please please please jot down _on a piece of paper_ some (or all) of the code that you wrote. Here's [how one this random alum approaches learning, _actual learning_ of complex technical material](https://josh.works/learning-how-to-learn)

Then delete the code from your editor and make the tests pass a second time.

[Here's a way of organizing a paper notebook that could be helpful right about now](https://josh.works/how-i-take-notes-aka-add-an-index-to-your-notebook)

The process of writing the code down by hand and rebuilding it feels _so hard_ when you first start it. Once you get in the habit, you'll experience the benefits. You'll learn 5x more if you write code down by hand, and redo each exercise at least once, after your initial pass through.
